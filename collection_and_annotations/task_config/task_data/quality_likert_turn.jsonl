I just got back from a trip to the beach, so I haven't had a chance to write in a while. I'm trying to get back into the swing of things."], ["user", "What beach did you go to?"], ["system", "I went to a beach near my house in florida. It was beautiful! It was a beautiful day! We went to the outer banks of florida, which is the first beach I've ever been to."], ["user", "Sounds like fun! Since you live in Florida, I'm assuming you've been to Universal Studios?"], ["system", "Yes, I have! I love universal studios! It's one of my favorite theme parks! I also love seaworld!"], ["user", "I especially like Island of Adventures at Universal! Have you also been to Miami?"], ["system", "No, I've only been to orlando, but I've always wanted to go to miami. I've never been to the southernmost part of the state!"], ["user", "I guess that typical of residents of their state. I live in Georiga, but I haven't been to the southernmost part of Georgia either."], ["system", "That's interesting! I didn't realize it was that far south! I wonder if there's a lot of wildlife there!"], ["user", "Georgia does have Okefenokee Swamp! I heard there's a lot of wildlife there, but I haven't been there yet."], ["system", "I've never heard of that! I'd love to go there! It would be a great place to visit!"], ["user", "Definitely. You should also visit Savannah."], ["system", "Savannah is a great city! It has a lot to offer. It's the oldest city in georgia, and it's also the capital of georgia."], ["user", "Well, Atlanta is the capital of Georgia now. I think you meant it was the first capital of Georiga."], ["system", "Yes, that's correct! Atlanta is now the second largest city in the state of georgia, after atlanta, georgia."], ["user", "I guess so. Anyways, have you visited any other states?"], ["system", "I haven't! I don't live in georgia anymore, but atlanta is a pretty big city. I'd like to visit there one day."], ["user", "Oh, did you use to live in Georiga before moving to Florida?"], ["system", "I used to! I lived in georgia for a few years, but then I moved to florida."], ["user", "Oh, that makes sense! Well, I hope you can visit Atlanta soon. I can show you around if you want."], ["system", "I hope you do! I know it's been a while since I've visited atlanta, but it would be nice to go back!"], ["user", "If I visit Florida, will you show me around?"], ["system", "Yes, you can! I'll show you all of atlanta! You can even take me on a tour of the georgia aquarium!"], ["user", "Will you show me around Florida then? It would be nice to have a local tour guide!"], ["system", "I'll definitely take you around! You'll have a great time! You should definitely visit atlanta!"], ["user", "I think we should both visit a new city instead. How does Miami sound?"], ["system", "Miami sounds like a nice city!

It's hot and there are a lot of smokers."], ["system", "I hear the beaches are nice there, where do you usually do something outdoors there?"], ["user", "I like to go out to the ocean, where the sand is soft and fluffy. But the pool is also nice! What about you?"], ["system", "I like the oceans and lakes and canoes, but prefer the beach. How about you, are yo u more of a pool person?"], ["user", "I like the pool because it's clean and clear, yes. Also, I don't like sand very much, so the pool is better than the beach in that regard."], ["system", "Have you ever heard of the beach sand farm? It is a big beach cleaning operation that cleans beaches. They also have other businesses too. I would like to check it out one day."], ["user", "Whoa, that's cool. I wonder what kind of equipment they use."], ["system", "Well, they need to use a sand-blaster that clears all the clay and broken particles. Then the whole pool is emptied and cleaned. You should check it up. It's very popular."], ["user", "Oh, they clean the pool? I thought they cleaned beaches. Imagine if they blew away all the sand on the beach! How dull it would be."], ["system", "They do sometimes, but I think for pools, they will use a more thorough process. Have you ever visited a private beach that just belongs to someone?"], ["user", "I've been to private beaches that belonged to hotels. They're nice."], ["system", "Did you not find it was very crowded? Or were these private beeches more affordable?"], ["user", "The price isn't too bad. I think crowding depends on the time of year, mostly, not the beach itself. It was very crowded over Memorial Day weekend, for example."], ["system", "Memoyrill weekend, huh? I can imagine that beach got pretty crowded that holiday weekend! My family often stays at beaches around the country. We have a membership at a resort beach so it's not that expensive. I think it's totally worth it even for just a few days"], ["user", "Yeah, that sounds pretty relaxing. Do you like the beaches better than the mountains?"], ["system", "Yes. The sand, the water, the beehives and butterflies. What isn't to like? And you can have fun on the mountians of course, but we really really like taking the kids to the beech"], ["user", "Oh, do you have kids?"], ["system", "No, unfortunately. Would love my own, though. Do you have any yourself? Are you thinking about any new ones?"], ["user", "I don't have children and won't have them for a long time, if at all. I guess it depends more on what my partner wants. I'm happy with my cats!"], ["system", "It's not for everyone. It helps me get through my job as a public librarian, though, at the local k-8. So I donate my time, which is important to me."], ["user", "Don't you get paid for your librarian job?"], ["system", "I do. But the pay's not great and it's tough to live on. I do it in case things get really difficult. Plus it's helped me build a little bit more of a network, which helps when there's a position opening at my actual job."], ["user", "Sure, that makes sense. What is your dream job?"], ["system", "Oh, that's a really tough one. A bit selfishly, it'd be to work for myself in a nonprofit or non-business related role and use that to fund my activities. What about you?"], ["user", "I would love to be a video game designer!"], ["system", "That's awesome! So many video game franchises are so creative and creative with the storylines!

I hope that isn't too far away?"], ["user", "Florida is pretty far away from where I live, but I'm sure it is nice to go see the ocean there."], ["system", "I bet. One of my favorite things here is driving from city to city. Driving around canada is one of the most peaceful things you could do"], ["user", "That's cool! What makes it so peaceful?"], ["system", "Because we are so few people and there are so many roads to drive on. Plus it gets really hot here in california so that can make a lot less traffic"], ["user", "Do you live in California?"], ["system", "Yes just about! I live in la but go to school elsewhere in cali, so I spend a considerable chunk of my free time driving around all the states. You?"], ["user", "I live in Missouri.

What's your favorite part about living in missouro? I miss the fall weather from back home"], ["user", "It is nice that it isn't super populated for a city.

I hear you on that, the city is a great place to be but can get very busy"], ["user", "I'm living in Kansas City now. It can get busy sometimes, but not that often."], ["system", "That's definitely a great big city. I can see how that would be very convenient for you.

It is nice to spend the day outside, especially after a stressful day."], ["system", "Yes, I totally understand!! Especially in such a beautiful place like kansas!

That's an amazing amount of age to get to know eachother, you're lucky. I also love the fact that they love me unconditionally. Cats are just the best"], ["user", "Technically their love isn't unconditional, you still have to respect your cat's boundaries and be a good owner. But if they like you, then it becomes a bond for life."], ["system", "Exactly! And they're always there when you need them, unlike some other animal.. Hahah jk but yeah I totally agree. Do they play or what?"], ["user", "Yes, they actually both play fetch! I think they're very smart and cute."], ["system", "Hahah! Thats so funny. I bet they like eating grass as well. I think they are cute, but im more of an alligator kinda person :)"], ["user", "Whoa, that's a big difference from cats. You're not scared of alligators? They seem pretty dangerous to me."], ["system", "I live in florida, so we are used to them! I have a little kid lol. The big alligated cats are cute too."], ["user", "What is an alligated cat?"], ["system", "It means they have an indigenous inversion like tabby cats! It makes them stand out a little more."], ["user", "Umm, okay, sore. Did you say you have a pet alligator, or am I reading into things wrong?"], ["system", "I have one! He's named bob. Bob the alligater. He's a bit of a woobie that way!"], ["user", "Haha, that's a funny name. Does your alligator try to eat your cats?"], ["system", "Sometimes they fight over the cats haha. I've noticed bob has a lot more white feathers then my other cats"], ["user", "You must have some really special pets if that is the case."], ["system", "I guess so haha. Bob is a strange little cat though! He chases things up trees"], ["user", "Oh my gosh, it's like I'm reading a suspense novel. What species is Bob???"], ["system", "I'm not too sure.

Do you enjoy musicals? I also love operas! I love the way they play out"], ["user", "Yeah, I like musicals and plays in general. Operas are a bit too slow for me, but maybe I should give them another shot."], ["system", "I love how they can tell so many personal stories, like what's going on with the singer and or actor"], ["user", "What's your favorite musical?"], ["system", "I like les miserables and also avenue q which is kind of different as it uses a lot of music and sondercast in order to tell a story"]], "bot_persona": ["my cats are very special to me.", "i've 5cats."]}]}

A lot of YA books are fantasy, but many fantasy books are not YA."], ["system", "Are there any specific topics you focus most on? Such as demon re-incarnation in your book, fantasy is hugely popular"], ["user", "Yeah, I think questions of identity and humanity are really interesting to explore in fiction."], ["system", "That makes sense. I would think that fiction would be used to explore complex issues, like in the novel \"a clockwork orange\" by orwell. Are you familiar with that one?"], ["user", "A friend has recommended it to me, yes, but I've never read it myself. What is it about?"], ["system", "Its about a revolutionary author who suffers from mental illness and anarchy in his newly released community."], ["user", "Oh wow, that does sound pretty interesting. So do you do any sports?"], ["system", "I run occasionally, I try to stay away from physical activity though. My health issues would make it difficult for me to continue. Do you play sports?

Yoga is good if you can't do strong cardio."], ["system", "My heart is just really slow. I can do exercise, but not for long. It's cool that martial arts helps with the mental aspect of it."], ["user", "Yeah, that's what my boyfriend said, too! There's a lot of mental discipline in martial arts that really appeals to me."], ["system", "Yes, there's a clear, rigid and definite way of doing things. And that keeps everyone on the same level. There's something peaceful about it, and a lot like a meditative state of mind."], ["user", "Right. What kinds of food do you like?"], ["system", "Whatever is on the menu, really.

I like thai food, but what's the connection to MMA?"], ["system", "Well, in thailand mma is a popular sport as well as in bangkok. The local population is very diverse, and has lots of people from around the world, so I think it appealed to them. Then I started watching it myself, and thought I could join in. You?"], ["user", "Wow, I didn't know that. I just like thai food for the flavors and curry! I like eating Asian food in general."], ["system", "That's interesting!
