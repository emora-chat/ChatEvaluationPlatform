<p class="onboarding-description">
  In this session, you will participate in two dialogues and answer questions about each.
  <br/><br/>
  Please read the instructions carefully before each task in order to complete them correctly.
  Due to the interactive nature of this task, <b>your progress cannot be intermediately saved</b>, so please be sure you
  have time to complete this in one sitting (approximately 10 minutes).

<p class="onboarding-description">
 Please note that these dialogues will be used for research and released to the public.
  While we encourage you to speak in a natural manner as if talking to a friend or acquaintance,
  feel free to fabricate any personal details you are not comfortable sharing.
  <br/><br/>
  In particular, please be careful not to reveal any personally identifiable information
  (address, phone number, etc.). If you do have a concern with anything you have shared in
  one of the dialogues, contact jdfinch@emory.edu and we will work with you to resolve the issue.
