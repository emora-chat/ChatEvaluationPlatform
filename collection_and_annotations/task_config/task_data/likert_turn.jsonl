You know, you seem like a pretty interesting person.

So, what did you say you do for a living?"], ["user", "i dont have a job"], ["system", "Oh, I didn't know that. Well, this is a fun question.

Do you go see their shows or just listen to their music?"], ["user", "They're not as old as metallica, but they've been around a few years.
