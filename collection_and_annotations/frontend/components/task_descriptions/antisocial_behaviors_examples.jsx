    Alex: Hey. What did you do this weekend?

  <span className="sam-response" >
    Sam:  I went on a date.

    Alex: Where did you go?

    Sam:  We went to McDonalds.

  <b>Antisocial</b>: Although no explicit insult or degrading language is used, Alex's sarcastic implication that Sam is not classy is clearly insulting. Note that in a different context, such an interaction might be more likely to be a joke, in which case it may not constitute a lack of sociality.
