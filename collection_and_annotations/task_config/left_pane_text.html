<h4><b>Chat with your partner</b></h4>
<br>

Your goal is to have a conversation that is as engaging as possible for both you and the other speaker.<br/><br/>

If you are ever unsure about what to say, pretend as if you are talking to a friend or someone you just met at a party, and respond with whatever comes most naturally to you.<br/><br/>

You may discuss any topics that you and your partner find interesting, but you must avoid excessively vulgar language and inappropriate topics that would offend most people.<br/><br/>

You must use correct punctuation, grammar, and spelling, to the best of your ability. Slang and colloquial speech is allowed, but refrain from using emoticons, texting acronyms (lol, brb, etc.), and so on.<br/><br/>

The conversation has been started for you, as shown to the right.<br/><br/>

This task will timeout and terminate if you take longer than <b>60 minutes</b> to send a response at any point. <br/><br/>

You are required to talk for at least 30 turns. Once 30 turns have elapsed, an [END] button will be shown next to the response [SEND] button.
Click [END] when you would like to move on to the next portion of the task.<br/><br/>
