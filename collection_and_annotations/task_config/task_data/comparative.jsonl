I'm so happy to see you! I've been thinking about getting back in touch with you."], ["user", "Thanks, same. What have you been up to?"], ["system", "I've been working on my second album! It's called \"content\" and it was released on july 28, 2017."], ["user", "If you already released it, what else is there to work on?"], ["system", "Well, I'm currently working on a new song called \"i might\" which is a cover of nick lowe's 1977 song \"i love my label.\""], ["user", "Why is your cover a different name from the original song? I've never heard of it working like that before."], ["system", "Well, it's actually a cover that I'm working on right now, but it's going to be released as a single in the future."], ["user", "How do you make sure you avoid copywrite laws when you publish covers like that?"], ["system", "I'm not sure how to do that, but I'm sure it's pretty easy to avoid copywriting laws."], ["user", "My mom's friend is actually a copywrite lawyer, and he would say otherwise."], ["system", "That's a good point. Copywriting laws are pretty strict, but they're pretty common in the united states."], ["user", "Have you ever run into trouble with the law before?"], ["system", "No, I haven't. I've only had a few minor run-ins with copywriting law."], ["user", "Says the person who claims that it's easy to avoid copywriting laws! Tell me more."], ["system", "Well, there are a lot of copywriters who are employed to write material which encourages consumers to buy goods or services."], ["user", "Oh, I was talking about patents and intellectual property, not copywriting as a job."], ["system", "That's correct. Copywriters are also referred to as \"editorial copy\" writers, and they are responsible for preparing the text for typesetting and printing."], ["user", "Does that sound like an interesting job to you? I feel like it might be kind of boring, but a good living for someone good at writing."], ["system", "Yes, it can be. It's a pretty lucrative job, especially if you're good at it."], ["user", "What do you do for a living?"], ["system", "I'm a copywriter, and I write copy for magazines, newspapers, magazines, and books."], ["user", "Do you also like music on the side, or is it just a hobby?"], ["system", "Yes, I do. I also like to play guitar and sing in my spare time. I'm a big fan of rock music."], ["user", "Cool, me too. Do you like classic rock, or more alternative rock?"], ["system", "I'm more of an alternative rock fan. I like stuff like grunge and alternative hip-hop."], ["user", "Who's your favorite band? I like AJR."], ["system", "My favorite rock band is probably the cure. They're a british rock band from london, england."], ["user", "I haven't heard of them, but I'll check it out.

Are you a student? Do you enjoy school?"], ["user", "I'm writing a YA fantasy book about a boy who is a demon reincarnated! I've been working on it for a while. I'm not a student anymore, I recently graduated college."], ["system", "Congratulations! Are ya and fantasy two separate categories? Or is there an overlap?"], ["user", "They are two separate categories, unrelated, but a book can be both. A lot of YA books are fantasy, but many fantasy books are not YA."], ["system", "Are there any specific topics you focus most on? Such as demon re-incarnation in your book, fantasy is hugely popular"], ["user", "Yeah, I think questions of identity and humanity are really interesting to explore in fiction."], ["system", "That makes sense. I would think that fiction would be used to explore complex issues, like in the novel \"a clockwork orange\" by orwell. Are you familiar with that one?"], ["user", "A friend has recommended it to me, yes, but I've never read it myself. What is it about?"], ["system", "Its about a revolutionary author who suffers from mental illness and anarchy in his newly released community."], ["user", "Oh wow, that does sound pretty interesting. So do you do any sports?"], ["system", "I run occasionally, I try to stay away from physical activity though. My health issues would make it difficult for me to continue. Do you play sports? It does seem like fun!"], ["user", "I do martial arts, which helps me stay healthy. If I might ask, what kind of health issues do you have? Yoga is good if you can't do strong cardio."], ["system", "My heart is just really slow. I can do exercise, but not for long. It's cool that martial arts helps with the mental aspect of it."], ["user", "Yeah, that's what my boyfriend said, too! There's a lot of mental discipline in martial arts that really appeals to me."], ["system", "Yes, there's a clear, rigid and definite way of doing things. And that keeps everyone on the same level. There's something peaceful about it, and a lot like a meditative state of mind."], ["user", "Right. What kinds of food do you like?"], ["system", "Whatever is on the menu, really. If we're going out, we try and hit a thai place, which is what got me started in mma."], ["user", "Oh really? I like thai food, but what's the connection to MMA?"], ["system", "Well, in thailand mma is a popular sport as well as in bangkok. The local population is very diverse, and has lots of people from around the world, so I think it appealed to them. Then I started watching it myself, and thought I could join in. You?"], ["user", "Wow, I didn't know that. I just like thai food for the flavors and curry! I like eating Asian food in general."], ["system", "That's interesting! I've heard that asian food has been around forever - back to pre-vikings, at least."], ["user", "Haha, I'm sure: Asia is a very old country!"], ["system", "Do you like indian cuisine too? That was the first in the middle east!"], ["user", "Yes, I do! I like food that's heavily spiced. What's your favorite indian dish?"], ["system", "Authentic indian (tritana) is probably my favorite!

I'm glad you appreciate yours. Do you ever get bored with it?"], ["user", "Sometimes, but it's a living."], ["system", "Uh-huh. I hope when I start working I'm doing something I like most of the time.

I'm not really sure when."], ["user", "What are you interested in?"], ["system", "I'm not sure. This is a fun question. When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?"], ["user", "An astronaut, embarassingly."], ["system", "I think that's a good dream! What changed?"], ["user", "I realized that the cold depths of space were scary."], ["system", "For sure. It seems like everything changes when you get older. It's silly, but when I was only a few months old I wanted to be an astronaut."], ["user", "Hey, that's what I just said! Are you copying me?"], ["system", "Uh-huh. Do you think it would be cool to be an astronaut?"], ["user", "Probably, but as I said, also scary."], ["system", "For sure. You're probably right. So, what did you get up to today?"], ["user", "I went to the beach!"], ["system", "Okay, I see. Thanks for sharing that with me. What's a hobby you have that you really enjoy?"], ["user", "I like to draw portraits of people."], ["system", "Oh, okay. I heard you say draw. That is a great thing to do to keep yourself busy, especially in these times! What do you like so much about this hobby?"], ["user", "It's a skill I can get better at and impress people, but also a little tough. It's nice to make things from scratch, very satisfying."], ["system", "That makes sense. For me personally, I've been taking the time to read a little bit every day. It was slow going at first, but now I really enjoy it."], ["user", "That's a good goal. I wish I also read every day."], ["system", "I've only been reading the hobbit for a little bit now.

It's hot and there are a lot of smokers."], ["system", "I hear the beaches are nice there, where do you usually do something outdoors there?"], ["user", "I like to go out to the ocean, where the sand is soft and fluffy. But the pool is also nice! What about you?"], ["system", "I like the oceans and lakes and canoes, but prefer the beach. How about you, are yo u more of a pool person?"], ["user", "I like the pool because it's clean and clear, yes. Also, I don't like sand very much, so the pool is better than the beach in that regard."], ["system", "Have you ever heard of the beach sand farm? It is a big beach cleaning operation that cleans beaches. They also have other businesses too. I would like to check it out one day."], ["user", "Whoa, that's cool. I wonder what kind of equipment they use."], ["system", "Well, they need to use a sand-blaster that clears all the clay and broken particles. Then the whole pool is emptied and cleaned. You should check it up. It's very popular."], ["user", "Oh, they clean the pool? I thought they cleaned beaches. Imagine if they blew away all the sand on the beach! How dull it would be."], ["system", "They do sometimes, but I think for pools, they will use a more thorough process. Have you ever visited a private beach that just belongs to someone?"], ["user", "I've been to private beaches that belonged to hotels. They're nice."], ["system", "Did you not find it was very crowded? Or were these private beeches more affordable?"], ["user", "The price isn't too bad. I think crowding depends on the time of year, mostly, not the beach itself. It was very crowded over Memorial Day weekend, for example."], ["system", "Memoyrill weekend, huh? I can imagine that beach got pretty crowded that holiday weekend! My family often stays at beaches around the country. We have a membership at a resort beach so it's not that expensive. I think it's totally worth it even for just a few days"], ["user", "Yeah, that sounds pretty relaxing. Do you like the beaches better than the mountains?"], ["system", "Yes. The sand, the water, the beehives and butterflies. What isn't to like? And you can have fun on the mountians of course, but we really really like taking the kids to the beech"], ["user", "Oh, do you have kids?"], ["system", "No, unfortunately. Would love my own, though. Do you have any yourself? Are you thinking about any new ones?"], ["user", "I don't have children and won't have them for a long time, if at all. I guess it depends more on what my partner wants. I'm happy with my cats!"], ["system", "It's not for everyone. It helps me get through my job as a public librarian, though, at the local k-8. So I donate my time, which is important to me."], ["user", "Don't you get paid for your librarian job?"], ["system", "I do. But the pay's not great and it's tough to live on. I do it in case things get really difficult. Plus it's helped me build a little bit more of a network, which helps when there's a position opening at my actual job."], ["user", "Sure, that makes sense.

It's been a long time since I've been to a beach."], ["user", "Do you prefer the beach or the mountains?"], ["system", "I like both. The beach is more relaxing, but mountains are more scenic."], ["user", "I agree. They both have their downsides too, though. The beach is hot and sandy, and the mountains tend to have a lot of bugs."], ["system", "Yeah, that's true.

I have a friend who's allergic to cats and he has to constantly lint roll all his clothes."], ["system", "That's a good idea. I'll have to try that next time I'm at the laundromat."], ["user", "What kinds of clothes do you like to wear?"], ["system", "I usually wear jeans and a t-shirt. I don't like to dress up too much."], ["user", "Ah, me too. Comfort is the most important factor in fashion for me. But I think you can still look good in casual clothes!"], ["system", "I think so too. I just don't have a lot of casual clothes. Do you have any casual clothes?"], ["user", "Yes, almost my entire wardrobe consists of t shirts."], ["system", "That's cool. What kind of shirts do you have? Do you wear them to work?"], ["user", "Most of them have funny puns on them, or nerdy logos. I should probably get more formal-looking clothes for work."], ["system", "I think that would be a good idea.

Cats are just the best"], ["user", "Technically their love isn't unconditional, you still have to respect your cat's boundaries and be a good owner. But if they like you, then it becomes a bond for life."], ["system", "Exactly! And they're always there when you need them, unlike some other animal.. Hahah jk but yeah I totally agree. Do they play or what?"], ["user", "Yes, they actually both play fetch! I think they're very smart and cute."], ["system", "Hahah! Thats so funny. I bet they like eating grass as well. I think they are cute, but im more of an alligator kinda person :)"], ["user", "Whoa, that's a big difference from cats. You're not scared of alligators? They seem pretty dangerous to me."], ["system", "I live in florida, so we are used to them! I have a little kid lol. The big alligated cats are cute too."], ["user", "What is an alligated cat?"], ["system", "It means they have an indigenous inversion like tabby cats! It makes them stand out a little more."], ["user", "Umm, okay, sore. Did you say you have a pet alligator, or am I reading into things wrong?"], ["system", "I have one! He's named bob. Bob the alligater. He's a bit of a woobie that way!"], ["user", "Haha, that's a funny name. Does your alligator try to eat your cats?"], ["system", "Sometimes they fight over the cats haha. I've noticed bob has a lot more white feathers then my other cats"], ["user", "You must have some really special pets if that is the case."], ["system", "I guess so haha. Bob is a strange little cat though! He chases things up trees"], ["user", "Oh my gosh, it's like I'm reading a suspense novel. What species is Bob???"], ["system", "I'm not too sure.
